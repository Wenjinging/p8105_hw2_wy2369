# Problem 1

### Import and clean data

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

The process begins with data import, updates variable names, and selects
the columns that will be used in later parts fo this problem. Update
`entry` from `yes` / `no` to a logical variable using `ifelse`.

As part of data import, we specify that `Route` columns 8-11 should be
character for consistency with 1-7.

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "./hw2data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

### Describe the dataset in a short paragraph.

Read data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`, and
clean it using `janitor::clean_names()`.The dataset contains
`line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, and ada`
variables. The resulting dataset has **1868** rows and **20** columns.

These data are not “tidy” because route number should be a variable, as
should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would need to convert
`route` variables from wide to long format.

### Explain how many distinct stations are there.

Use `distinct()` to select station name and line, and then obtain all
unique combinations. As a result, the number of rows in this dataset is
the number of unique stations. There are **465** distinct stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

### Explain how many stations are ADA compliant.

Use `filter()` as an initial step to find how many stations are ADA
cpmpliant. This produces a dataframe in which the number of rows is the
number of ADA compliant stations. Hence, **84** stations are ADA
compliant.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

### Compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.

First exclude station entrances that do not allow vending. Then, use
`entry` variable – this logical. Taking the mean will produce the
desired proportion, which is **0.3770492**.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

### Compute the stations that serve the A train and how many A train stations are ADA compliant.

Firstly, tidy the data as alluded to previously and convert `route` from
wide to long format by using `pivot_longer()`. After this step, we can
use tools from previous parts of the question. We get **60** stations
that serve A train and **17** of these stations are ADA compliant.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    station_name                  line           
    ##    <chr>                         <chr>

# Problem 2

### Import, clean, and organize **Mr. Trash Wheel** sheet.

Use code `read_excel` to read, and `janitor::clean_names()` to clean
data from `Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx`. Omit non-data rows and
columns, and then round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer. After that, convert the result to an integer variable by using
`as.integer`.

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./hw2data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N550") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (c(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls,digits = 0) )%>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) ,data_source = "mr_trash_wheel",year = as.integer(year))
```

### Import, clean, and organize **Professor Trash Wheel** sheet.

Use a similar process to organize the data from Professor Trash Wheel
sheet.

``` r
prof_trash_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./hw2data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:M97") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (c(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(data_source = "prof_trash_wheel")
```

### Combine the two datasets.

Use code `bind_rows` to combine `mr_trash_df` and `prof_trash_df` , and
get `trash_tidy` dataset.

``` r
trash_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df,prof_trash_df) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 

trash_tidy
```

date, weight_tons, and glass_bottles. The data frame has **641** rows
and **15** columns.

``` r

  trash_tidy %>%
  filter(data_source == "prof_trash_wheel") 
  sum(weight_proTrash$weight_tons)
```

    ## [1] 190.12

**190.12**.

``` r
year_2020 = 
  trash_tidy %>%
  filter(data_source == "mr_trash_wheel", year == 2020)
  sum(year_2020$sports_balls)
```

    ## [1] 856
